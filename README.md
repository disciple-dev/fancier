# Fancier
An image management library for enthusiasts.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` in the cloned directory.

I have incldued image data in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
Two options are available:
1. Execute `node index.js`
2. Execute `./search.sh`

Running the script without arguments will return all images.

Run with the `--help` flag to display usage information, e.g. `./search.sh --help`.
